## To control a **Traffic Light System** using an **Arduino Uno** and a **Raspberry Pi**, you can use the Raspberry Pi to act as the control center that communicates with the Arduino Uno to manage the traffic light system.

### Aim:
To design a **Traffic Light Control System** using an **Arduino Uno** for controlling the LEDs and a **Raspberry Pi** to handle the logic and communication. The Raspberry Pi will send commands to the Arduino to control the traffic lights, and the Arduino will manage the LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) accordingly.

### Components Needed:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or later)
3. 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
4. **Resistors** (220Ω or 330Ω)
5. **Breadboard**
6. **Jumper wires**
7. **USB cable** to connect Arduino to Raspberry Pi
8. **Raspberry Pi OS** with Python installed

## ALGORITHAM :

### **Steps:**
1. **Wiring Setup:**
- **Connect the LEDs to the Arduino:**
  - Connect the **Red LED** to Pin 12.
  - Connect the **Yellow LED** to Pin 11.
  - Connect the **Green LED** to Pin 10.
  - Use a 220Ω resistor for each LED in series to limit the current.
 
## OUTPUT :
